# CVSAP CVS Adapter Protocol
## origin
In a project, GIT SVN and other version control systems need to be integrated. It is found that the existing relevant protocols fight their own battles and are not friendly to integrating a variety of version control systems. This idea came into being after referring to vscode syntax adapter protocol LSP and debugging adapter protocol DAP. The workload of integrating many subsystems is huge. Anyone is welcome to join the project. However, this document is only limited to the creation of the agreement.

The protocol contains two roles from Client and Server:
 - Client Specification
 - Server Specification
